# GameFeed

The application provides information about the video games according to their release date, genre, and platform. It enables you search, filter, share or get full details of the games. Demo of the application can be found [here](https://gamesfeed.netlify.app).

To obtain video games, [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/) is used. For styling, [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/) library is used.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`
